1. Create a Calculator class
having following methods
a. add (n1,n2)
this method should return sum of n1,n2
b. subtract(n1,n2)
this method should return difference between n1,n2
c. multiplication(n1,n2)
this method should return result of multiplication of  n1,n2
2. Create mycalci object
3. With user input call different methods
